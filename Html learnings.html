        <h2 style="text-align:center;">VON NEUMANN ARCHITECTURE</h2>
        <p>The <b>Von Neumann Architecture</b> is about the structure that a computer should follow.</p>
        <p></p>Most computers today follow this framework.</p>
       <p> This architecture is based on 1945 description by <b><i>John von Neumann</i></b></p>
       A Von Neumann-based computer has the following characteristics:
        <ul type ="square">
           <li>Utilises a single processor</li>
           <li>Utilises one memory for both instructions and data</li>
           <li>Implements programs by executing one instruction at a time</li>
           <li>Has a single bus for memory access</li>
           <li>Its processor operates fetching and executing cycles seriously</li>
        </ul>
        The Von Neumann Architecture has the following components:
        <ol type ="1">
           <li>Central Processing Unit (CPU) </li>
           <li>Immediate Access Store (IAS)</li>
           <li>Input/Output(I/O)</li>
        </ol>

        <br>
        <p><u>Central Processing Unit</u></p>
        <p>The CPU governs the computer and handles the data. It has four main parts as follows:</p>
        <ul type ="disk">
           <li><b>Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)</b></li>
           <li><b>Control Unit</b></li>
           <li><b>Registers</b></li>
           <li><b>Clock</b></li>
        </ul>
        <p><u>Immediate Access Store</u></p>
        This is commonly reffered to as the Random Access Memory (RAM) or Main Memory. It stores both instructions and data.
        <p><u>Input/Output (I/O)</u></p>
        It refers to the accessories for inputting and outputting data.
        <p><b>Advantages:</b></p>
        <ul type="circle">
            <li>The control unit gets data and instructions in the same way from one memory</li>
            <li>It simplifies design and development of the CU</li>
            <li>Data from memory and from devices are accessed in the same way</li>
            <li>Development of CU is cheaper and faster than Harvard</li>
            <li>It is better for desktop computers, laptops, workstations and high performances computers</li>
            <li>The program can be optimised in smaller size</li>
            <li>The code is executed serially and takes more clock cycles</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Disadvantages:</b></p>
        <ul type="circle">
            <li>Bottlenedding is an issue because only one bit of information can be accessed at once</li>
            <li>Confussion between data instructions can lead to a system crash</li>
            <li>Instruction stored in the same memory as the data can be accidently rewritten by an error in a program</li>
            <li>Serial instruction processing does not allow parallel execution of the program</li>
            <li>Only handles one task at a time</li>
        </ul>
